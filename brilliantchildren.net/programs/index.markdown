The Brilliant Children after-school program is designed for kindergarten and transitional kindergarten to help them have fun, learn from each other, and build their mental capacity. The kids here come right from school and join their peers for an evening of fun, laughter, activities, and friendship. The fun starts after school and ends at 6 pm or 8 pm when the parents are expected to come and pick them. The TK and kindergarten are perfect for your kids and their development.

Brilliant Children know how much it means for you to see your children perform excellently in school. For this reason, we have created the afternoon program for TK/kindergarten to third, fourth, fifth grade, and sixth grade. We offer them immense opportunity to be themselves and use the tools and resources we provide for them to create their own world and build their mental energy. Apart from tools we also provide the kind of activities that are loved by parents and children, so they are familiar with what we have to offer, which drives them to participate with joy and excitement.
