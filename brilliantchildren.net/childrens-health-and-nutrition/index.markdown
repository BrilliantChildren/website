We Give Children The Best Of Health Attention And Nutritional Food That Ensure Their Safety

We take the children’s health and nutrition very seriously. Children are given a lunch that contains fruits, vegetables, water, and essential mineral in form of milk. The mid-afternoon snack changes in menu, as we intend to make the food appealing and at the same time nutritious. When kids stay longer on site, they are served pasta, crackers, veggies, and homemade soup. A child that is sick will not be accepted into Brilliant Children programs. If they get sick in school or from home, they will not be accepted.

If a child becomes sick during the program he or she will be isolated from other children and the parents will be called to pick them up for further medical attention. If there is an injury or emergency, we will try every effort to make sure that the parents of the child or children involved are immediately notified. If children require medication parents should not send medication to Brilliant children in the backpack. For every child that requires medication during the program, the parents must fill a medication request form on site before admission will be allowed. Before a staff will be allowed to put sunscreen on a child, the parents will also be asked to complete a sunscreen release form.
