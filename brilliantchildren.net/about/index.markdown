](http://brilliantchildren.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/391A8566.jpg)Brilliant Children have three types of programs where kids can participate in, for kindergarteners and transitional kindergarteners. There is the before school program that starts at 8 am for kids who need attention before the regular school begins. There is also the after-school program which starts after school dismissal and lasts until 8 pm. All of these programs have been specially designed to provide children with the skills they need to improve mentally, psychologically, and physically. We also offer summer holidays that run from 8 am to 8 pm, for those summer months when schools are out. We serve mid-afternoon snacks each day that contains crackers, milk, cheese, veggies, fresh fruits, etc., to guarantee that the kids have all the nutrients they need. We also celebrate birthdays, instill a strict disciplinary policy, and the kids have access to a wide variety of toys and games.




Safety remains our most critical consideration with the children taking part in our programs. Only people who are authorized by the parents will be allowed to pick up the children, which will require a photo ID for authentication. We also have a place where children who fall sick are taken care of while the parents are called upon. Brilliant Children is a top class before and after school academy that is fully committed to ensuring that every child under our care gets everything they need to succeed. Parents will find our services commendable, and the right and perfect option to help take care of the needs of their children.

We Give Children The Best Of Health Attention And Nutritional Food That Ensure Their Safety




We take the children’s health and nutrition very seriously. Children are given a lunch that contains fruits, vegetables, water, and essential mineral in form of milk. The mid-afternoon snack changes in menu, as we intend to make the food appealing and at the same time nutritious. When kids stay longer on site, they are served pasta, crackers, veggies, and homemade soup. A child that is sick will not be accepted into Brilliant Children programs. If they get sick in school or from home, they will not be accepted.




If a child becomes sick during the program he or she will be isolated from other children and the parents will be called to pick them up for further medical attention. If there is an injury or emergency, we will try every effort to make sure that the parents of the child or children involved are immediately notified. If children require medication parents should not send medication to Brilliant children in the backpack. For every child that requires medication during the program, the parents must fill a medication request form on site before admission will be allowed. Before a staff will be allowed to put sunscreen on a child, the parents will also be asked to complete a sunscreen release form.

We Take Safety And Discipline Issues Serious Because It’s Our Responsibility To Make Sure Every Child Is Safe And Happy




Brilliant Children works very hard to ensure that all kids in our possession are safe and secured at all time, to ensure the parents meet them well when they come to pick them up. This is why we have put in place a strong safety and disciplinary policy to ensure that all kids are safe. During admission, every child is eligible and allowed to participate, no matter their background. But best behavior has to be maintained to protect the site and ensure that activities go on without any problems.




If a child misbehaves and displays a behavior that are deemed inconsistent with the policy of the academy; that is fighting, teasing, bullying, etc., he or she will be separated from the group for a while. A staff will afterward talk to the child and make sure that he or she promises not to exhibit such behavior again. But if after the discussion the kid still misbehaves the parents will be asked to come and pick up the child. If the child returns and continues to behave in such a manner that puts the site in a position that makes it unconducive for other kids then the child will be removed and not allowed to come back. We want to make sure that the site remains safe and secure for everyone.
