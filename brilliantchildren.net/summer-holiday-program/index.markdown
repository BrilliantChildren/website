During the summer months, children spend plenty of time at home and away from school. The long holiday is a serious issue for parents as they need to find ways to make their kids get busy. Brilliant Children has a solution to this, in the form of the summer holiday school. The program runs for weeks during the summer months, from 8 am to 8 pm. Our summer holiday program is affordable and is the best option to help prevent brain drain in your children.




What activities will the kids get involved with during this month? Our summer programs involve both indoor and outdoor activities where the kids learn about freedom and the basic principles of life. They also have the time to connect new friends, play games, do simple sports, and engage in more fun and adventurous activities. Children may also participate in exercise, and take full advantage of the time to rest their brain from academic lessons and move closer to nature. They also get to widen their horizon by learning music, arts, and culture, and taking part in lessons that teach them about history and heritage.




Summer holiday help children learn about life skills, which will make them become resilient and though young people. They also stay active and keep away from video games and TV, and take part in activities that will develop their soul, body, and mind in no small way. They also take part in new adventures to discover new places, meet new friends, and engage in more interesting activities. Parents who allow their kids to come to summer holiday programs have more rest of mind because they know we are capable of keeping the children happy, safe, and secured.
