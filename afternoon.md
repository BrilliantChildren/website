Brilliant Children know how much it means for you to see your children perform excellently in school. For this reason, we have created the afternoon program for TK/kindergarten to third, fourth, fifth grade, and sixth grade. We offer them immense opportunity to be themselves and use the tools and resources we provide for them to create their own world and build their mental energy. Apart from tools we also provide the kind of activities that are loved by parents and children, so they are familiar with what we have to offer, which drives them to participate with joy and excitement.




What makes the afternoon program more interesting is that we allow children to choose which activity best suites them. Some kids like to play games while others want to get involved with something more fun, adventurous, and energetic. Giving the children the right to choose what they want to makes it easier for them to properly immerse themselves in the activities so they can improve their overall performance in school. The children in the afternoon program are enrolled from TK/Kindergarten until they move on to middle school.




Our afternoon program provides so many benefits for the kids in no small measures. It offers safety and health for the kids. If you’re a parent that stays long at work and comes back at night, you don’t want your kids running around the neighborhood. You also may not want to hire a nanny as that might even be more expensive, and you’re not still guaranteed of their safety because you’re not there. Our afternoon school eliminates all of that worry as you’re guaranteed of the safety and health of the children. Parents who worry less have more energy to spend with their kids at night when they return from work. They are not just safe but also engaged in productive activities that improve their learning in so many ways.
