The Brilliant Children after-school program is designed for kindergarten and transitional kindergarten to help them have fun, learn from each other, and build their mental capacity. The kids here come right from school and join their peers for an evening of fun, laughter, activities, and friendship. The fun starts after school and ends at 6 pm or 8 pm when the parents are expected to come and pick them. The TK and kindergarten are perfect for your kids and their development.




There are so many activities lined up for all the kids participating in this program. They will be taking part in fun indoor activities like drawing, singing, counting, and rhymes. We have made it in such a way that whatever theyâ€™re learning here is different from the activities they performed in school, which makes it even more interesting as they get to learn new stuff. They will also participate in outdoor activities that improve their health and help them become more active and energized. Our caregivers give every child attention and help them create a better connection among themselves by making them work together.




There are so many benefits to enrolling your kids in this program one of which is the connection with other kids where they learn even more social skills. The activities they perform are used as a way of tasking their brain and challenging them to learn simple problem-solving skills. Unlike in the classroom where most of the work is in books, pictures, and images, we make them work with real-life elements that trigger their imagination and propel them to create amazing projects they can show themselves.




Participants also get to work on their homework where we help them find the best way to solve problems, which we have seen have helped many kids learn several subjects from different perspectives. We provide an inviting environment for the kids to learn, have fun, and interact. Here, they are free to do whatever they like and move around, and we provide everything they need for all of their activities. We also provide them with nutritious lunch, give them challenging tasks, and allow them to use their own imagination to deliver solutions to their problems.
