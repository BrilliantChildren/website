Brilliant Children Provides Your Child With The Opportunity To Discover Their Capacity And Become Better In Life




Every child has the potential to become great in life. However, what they are exposed to, at their young age, will determine their level of success and performance in school. Brilliant Child is an after-school program designed to help young kids find their passion, express themselves, and discover who they are early in life. Our programs are geared towards those at elementary grade levels. Our programs run from 8 am, before or after kindergarten start and dismissal, and an afternoon program that runs after dismissal up until 8 pm.




Help Your Children Learn The Social Skills They Need To Be Able To Survive In An Ever Changing World




The world is changing all the time. Technology, culture, and policies are bringing the world together and turning things in a different direction from the way they used to be. Our after-school program is designed to help your kids learn basic social skills they need to interact with their peers and improve on relationship, confidence, and communication. Many studies and documentation have been done on the benefits of school-age children acquiring relevant social interaction.




When kids relate with other kids they’re able to build their self-confidence to talk, discuss, and interact with their peers. It also helps in language development as kids learn a lot from what their peers say than what adults say, and it also helps them in developing necessary problem-solving skills. Our after school program also improve children’s concerted cultivation by incorporating organized activities into their lives.




Parents Who Bring Their Children To Us Have Seen The Impact We Are Creating With Our Unique Style Of After-school Activities




What makes us proud more than ever is the impact we’re creating in the lives of these children. Brilliant Children provides a conducive environment, with all the essential elements that make kids feel at home so that they can learn. We also have a dedicated staff of people who are parents themselves and have a deep understanding of how to help these kids know exactly what they needed to know. We also provide every child with the tools, resources, lesson notes, and content, to help them create the perfect atmosphere for them to achieve greatness. We believe that for kids to grow into responsible adults, they must be provided with everything they need.




Parents have expressed that by attending our programs, their kids have developed better in behaviors, social habits, values, morals, and communication. These kids also perform better in their schools, have a better sense of responsibility, and are usually the ones who want to volunteer to solve problems. Parents also love that these children are properly taken care of by us, as we take it upon ourselves to provide them with all the nourishment they need to grow strong and healthy. Safety is also a major aspect of our concern as we ensure that every child remains safe and secured while they try to live and take part in all the activities they are meant to take part in. Brilliant Children offer excellent services that parents will always be proud of.

 	  * There’s a healthy and fun snack for you to enjoy
 	  * There’s a friend to share a joke, game, or secret
 	  * There’s a quiet space to work and someone to help you with your homework
 	  * There’s outdoor space for you to run, jump, play, and let loose after being indoors
 	  * There’s always plenty to do, friends to do it with, and adults who know just how special you are
