We Take Safety And Discipline Issues Serious Because Itâ€™s Our Responsibility To Make Sure Every Child Is Safe And Happy

Brilliant Children works very hard to ensure that all kids in our possession are safe and secured at all time, to ensure the parents meet them well when they come to pick them up. This is why we have put in place a strong safety and disciplinary policy to ensure that all kids are safe. During admission, every child is eligible and allowed to participate, no matter their background. But best behavior has to be maintained to protect the site and ensure that activities go on without any problems.

If a child misbehaves and displays a behavior that are deemed inconsistent with the policy of the academy; that is fighting, teasing, bullying, etc., he or she will be separated from the group for a while. A staff will afterward talk to the child and make sure that he or she promises not to exhibit such behavior again. But if after the discussion the kid still misbehaves the parents will be asked to come and pick up the child. If the child returns and continues to behave in such a manner that puts the site in a position that makes it unconducive for other kids then the child will be removed and not allowed to come back. We want to make sure that the site remains safe and secure for everyone.
