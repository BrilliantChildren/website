Kids are filled with so much enthusiasm and joy while they go off to school in the morning. They are energetic, ready to face the day, and will do anything to ensure they have fun. But sometimes, things donâ€™t work well, and they lost the desire to, somewhere in the process. This is why we have created the before school program to cater for kids who need to have a happy and inspiring head start for the day. Our before school program runs from 8 am in the morning until schools open, and it includes early bird, and late bird.




Before School is filled with so many fun activities kids enjoy and are always ready to participate in. The kids get to take part in different indoor activities including crafts making, drawing, and other fun and learning activities. Children also take part in outdoor events like watering plants and learning how they absorb water from the soil. Such knowledge can have a serious impact on their development and help them learn about other living things around them.




Our Before School is perfectly designed to help kids achieve better performance in their school work. Kids that take part often attend a school which helps to boost school attendance. The more kids can show up in school, not missing lessons, the more they get to connect with their peers and learn. The academy also provides a better structure for children to make them more responsible for social and academic excellence.




Kids who participate in the classes also develop better socialization skills. They meet with other children from various places and connect with the aim of exchanging ideas and providing complete value that transforms their personality into something the parents will enjoy. Our Before School also involves activities where the kids learn new things and develop their internal skills, which they will later exhibit during school hours. We understand how important the children need to acquire basic knowledge fast and improve on their performance and verbal delivery when they are among their peers.
